# REBORN_API

to get all of the stuff easily just do

local handler = loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamExpo/REBORN_API/master/Source'),true))()

in the bottom of the source it shows u how to create commands and keybinds, ill make an actual thing of showing off all the stuff like teleport functions in a bit for now it'll
just be the source code so just look through the functions yourself in the source to see what u can do for now.
